## About Me:
  Hi! My name is Jonathan Vu, and I'm a Software Engineering student at RIT.
  
  I went to John F. Kennedy Senior High School in Buffalo, New York, and during my time there I joined many clubs such as Class Government, 
  the bowling team, the Foreign Language Club, etc. My hobbies include reading, playing games, playing tennis, and generally just trying out
  things that I find cool or interesting, whether it be listening to new music, eating different foods, or actual full-fledged activities.
  
  My favorite food, even since I was a kid is sushi:

  Here's what I'd like to learn from this course:
  * More about the business side of Software Engineering
  * What makes or breaks a professional in this field
  * Some tips and tricks to keep in mind as I move forward down this path
